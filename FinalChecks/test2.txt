RICHER IN CONTEMPORARY NUANCE AND PSYCHOLOGICAL SHADING (THAN THE DAY OF THE JACKAL), THE DECEIVER IS A VALENTINE TO THE ESPIONAGE THRILLER. IT IS ALSO A ROLLING GOOD READ -THE NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW Frederick Forsyth, master of the international thriller, takes us deeper than ever into the secret corridors of power to tell the riveting story of a modern spymaster fighting to save his career. His name is Sam McCready and for years he has been the Deceiver. As an intrepid and inventive field agent, McCready's independent style has often driven him beyond the rules. He has not been afraid to press the CIA to the explosion point--or to play cat-and-mouse with the KGB. He has successfully tricked Qaddafi and the IRA and once even set himself up as governor of a remote Caribbean island torn between Fidel Castro and the Colombian drug trade. But times have changed and mavericks like McCready are an endangered species. Now, before a panel of his peers, McCready must defend his unorthodox exploits or face dismissal. What hangs in the balance is not only his own career, but the very future of British intelligence.
